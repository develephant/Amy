## Amy is Awesome!

__Amy__ App Stack is a _semi-opinionated_ [__AngularJS__](http://angularjs.org), [__Material UI__](https://material.angularjs.org), and [__Electron__](http://electron.atom.io)  project starter for your, soon-to-be, awesome __Electron__ App.

One major feature is the integration of the [__ngElectron__](https://github.com/develephant/ngElectron) module for __AngularJS__.  The module allows for easy communication between the __Electron__ and __AngularJS__ layers.  The module also provides direct access to __Electron__ itself!

__Amy__ app stack is not for the unmotivated developer.  Both __AngularJS__ and __MaterialUI__ take some effort to master, but allow you to make some really awesome __Electron__ and __AngularJS__ desktop applications using popular and up-and-coming tools.

Feel free to submit any issues, pushes, or [job offers](https://twitter.com/develephant). Thanks!

## Installing __Amy__

To invite __Amy__ App Stack to your development environment, simply download the [__ZIP archive__](https://github.com/develephant/Amy/zipball/master) or [__TAR archive__](https://github.com/develephant/Amy/tarball/master). Once your download completes, decompress the downloaded archive.

> __Rename the new directory with your own project name.__

At this point, you need to open your terminal, and navigate to the new project folder.

`cd my-amy-project`

`./amy-setup`

> __If `amy-setup` won't open, you can try running `chmod +x amy-setup` first.__

This will set up all the dependencies for __Amy__. Once that's over, you're ready to code!

### Running

For best demonstration results, you will need to open __Amy__ using the command line. You can the find the Electron __path__ by opening your [__Electron__](https://github.com/atom/electron/releases) loader. With the command line, navigate inside your __Amy__ project folder and run (for example OSX):

`/Users/coronium/Desktop/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron .`

> __Note the dot ' .' at the end.__

Hit enter, and this should open up the project and show console output. Play around with stuff.
